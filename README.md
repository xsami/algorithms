# Algorithm

The purpose of this repo is to store algorithms that I have solved in different website, interviews, or made by myself

### TODO:

Make a section for data structure implementations and algorithms
Try to complete the algorithm from this website: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/
updates: add more test

* Fundamentals of programming
* Time Complexity
* Good Practices
* Data Structures
* Trade-Off
* Divide and Conquer
* Suffix array
* Graphs - strongly connected components
* Knapsack algorithm
* Traveler problem
* Dijkstra
* Vertex Cover

Here we go again...
