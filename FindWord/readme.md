# Find Word

Given an array of string your task it's to return the desired word.
Examples:

Give the following array:  [ 'P>E', 'E>R', 'R>U']
Your function should return: "PERU"

Give the following array:  ["I>N","A>I","P>A","S>P"]
Your function should return: "SPAIN"


In the first example you can see that E goes after P,
then you can form the string PE -> PER -> PERU

You can assume that there's no repeated letter and all are upper case english letters.
